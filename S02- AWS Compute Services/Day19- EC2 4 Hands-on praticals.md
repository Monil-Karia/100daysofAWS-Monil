# AWS EC2 Practice Exercises

Welcome to the AWS EC2 Practice Exercises! This series of hands-on exercises is designed to help graduates and those with limited AWS experience gain practical exposure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 concepts. Whether you're looking to fill knowledge gaps or build confidence in working with AWS services, these exercises are a great way to get started.

## Overview

This series is divided into multiple exercises, each focusing on different aspects of AWS EC2. You can complete them in sequence to progressively build your understanding and hands-on skills. Here's a brief overview of the exercises:
