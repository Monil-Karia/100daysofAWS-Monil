# Day 12: Instance Costs

## Five Main Drivers Affecting Instance Cost

1. **Instance Purchasing Options**
2. **Tenancy**
3. **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**
4. **EC2 Instance Types**
5. **Storage Type and Size**

## Instance Purchasing Options

- **On-Demand Instances:**
  - Pay for compute capacity per second or by the hour
  - No long-term commitments or upfront payments
  - Use case: Short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads
  - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCA0Gtg91bk)
- **Reserved Instances (RI):**
  - Up to 72 percent discount compared to On-Demand Instances
  - Prepay for capacity (1-year or 3-year options)
  - Use case: Predictable workloads lasting longer than 1 year

- **Savings Plans Instances:**
  - Two types: Compute Savings Plans (up to 66% discount) and EC2 Instance Savings Plans (up to 72% discount, similar to Standard RIs)
  - Apply to EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda usage
  - Use case: Long-term workloads, flexible computing needs

- **Spot Instances:**
  - Purchase unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% off on-demand pricing
  - Prices controlled by AWS based on supply and demand
  - Use case: Flexible start/end time applications, low-cost computing needs, urgent computing needs for additional capacity
