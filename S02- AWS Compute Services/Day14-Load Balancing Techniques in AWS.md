# Load Balancing Techniques in AWS

Load balancing in AWS is a crucial practice for ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and optimal performance of your applications. AWS provides a range of load balancing services that automate the distribution of network traffic, making it easier to scale your applications seamlessly. This README provides a brief overview of these techniques:

## Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Balances traffic at the application level, ideal for HTTP/HTTPS-based applications.

- **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Offers low-latency transport-layer balancing, suitable for TCP/UDP traffic.

- **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**: Provides basic HTTP/HTTPS load balancing.

## Global Accelerator

- Routes traffic globally based on predefined policies, optimizing performance and reliability.

## Route 53 DNS-Based Load Balancing

- Uses DNS-based routing to direct traffic to AWS resources, supporting latency-based and geolocation-based routing.

## Auto Scaling with Load Balancers

- Automatically adjusts the number of instances using load balancers to meet application demand, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.

## Application Auto Scaling

- Automatically scales various AWS resources based on defined policies, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

## Cross-Region Load Balancing

- Supports disaster recovery and high availability by deploying load balancers across different AWS regions.

## Container and Lambda Load Balancing

- Balances traffic for containerized applications and Lambda functions.

## WAF Integration

- Combines Web Application Firewall (WAF) with ALB for enhanced security.

## TLS/SSL Termination

- Offloads SSL decryption from backend instances to improve efficiency.

## Connection Draining and Stickiness

- Manages connection termination and session stickiness for a smoother user experience.

## Health Checks and Monitoring

- Monitors the health and performance of backend instances, automatically replacing unhealthy ones.
