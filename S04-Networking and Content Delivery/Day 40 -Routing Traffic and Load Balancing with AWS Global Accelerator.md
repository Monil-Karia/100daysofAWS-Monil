# Routing Traffic and Load Balancing with AWS Global Accelerator

AWS Global Accelerator plays a crucial role in optimizing traffic routing and load balancing for enhanced application availability and performance.

## Routing Traffic

AWS Global Accelerator utilizes the following techniques to optimize traffic routing:

- **Anycast IP:** Leveraging Anycast IP addresses, it efficiently directs users to the nearest AWS edge location, thereby reducing latency.
- **Health Checking:** Constantly monitors the health status of endpoints and automatically diverts traffic away from unhealthy endpoints to ensure high availability.

## Load Balancing

Global Accelerator implements various load balancing techniques to ensure efficient traffic distribution:

- **Traffic Distribution:** Equally distributes incoming traffic across healthy endpoints, thereby enhancing overall application performance.
- **Session Persistence:** Supports session stickiness, ensuring subsequent user requests are directed to the same endpoint, maintaining session continuity.
- **Zonal Redundancy:** Provides redundancy across multiple Availability Zones, bolstering fault tolerance and minimizing downtime.

This structured information provides an overview of how AWS Global Accelerator manages traffic routing and load balancing, ultimately improving application availability and performance.
