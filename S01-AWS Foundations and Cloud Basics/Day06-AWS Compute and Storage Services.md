## AWS Compute Overview

### Virtual Servers (Instances)

In AWS, virtual servers known as instances are your compute resources. They offer various sizes and configurations, allowing you to select the right CPU, memory, and storage for your workloads.

### Elasticity

AWS compute brings elasticity to the table. Easily scale instances up or down to match demand fluctuations. Handle traffic spikes by adding more instances and save during quieter periods by reducing capacity.

### Instance Types

AWS provides a diverse range of instance types, optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and GPU-accelerated. Choosing the right instance type is vital for cost-effective performance.

For detailed information, refer to:
- [Amazon EC2 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2): Detailed information on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.
- [AWS Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda): Official documentation for AWS Lambda, the serverless computing service.

## AWS Storage Overview

### Block vs. Object Storage

AWS offers two primary storage types. Block storage (e.g., Amazon EBS) resembles traditional hard drives and is commonly used with EC2 instances. Object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) is designed for unstructured data like files, images, and backups.

### Durability and Availability

AWS storage ensures high durability and availability. Data is redundantly stored across multiple data centers, guaranteeing accessibility even in hardware failure scenarios.

### Scalability

Easily scale storage resources to accommodate growing data needs without disrupting your applications.

For detailed information, refer to:
- [Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3): Detailed information on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), AWS's object storage service.
- [Amazon EBS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs): Documentation for Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), AWS's block storage service.
- [Amazon Glacier Information](https://aws.amazon.com/glacier): Details about Amazon Glacier, AWS's long-term archival storage service.
