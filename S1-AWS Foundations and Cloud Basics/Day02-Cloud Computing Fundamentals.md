## Cloud Computing Fundamentals

This provides an overview of cloud computing fundamentals, including what cloud computing is, its benefits, service models and deployment models.

## What is Cloud?

- Cloud refers to a network or the internet.
- It provides services over WAN, LAN, or VPN.
- Applications like email, CRM, and web conferencing run on the cloud.

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- It includes servers, networks, storage, and applications.

## Why Cloud Computing?

- IT assets are programmatically accessible for quick setup and resource management.
- Resources are accessed dynamically for agility and flexibility.
- Pay-as-you-go pricing allows cost control.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing:

- Trade-off between upfront and variable expenses.
- Leveraging economies of scale.
- Increased speed, agility, and global reach.
- Focus on applications instead of data centre management.
- Eliminating capacity guessing.
- Go global in minutes

## Cloud Service Models:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides basic building blocks for IT virtual resources. E.g. : Amazon EC2.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Provides the development environment and removes infrastructure management. E.g. : AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Provides complete, managed software products. E.g. : Video conferencing, email, file sharing sites.

## Deployment Models:

- **Public Cloud:** Easily accessible to the general public.
- **Private Cloud (On-Premises):** Accessible within an organisation.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private cloud.
- **Community Cloud:** It shares the infrastructure between several organisations from a specific community.

## On-Premises vs. Cloud:

To help differentiate between running workloads on-premises and in the cloud, consider a scenario in which developers must deploy a new application feature. Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate quality assurance (QA) environment that has the same configurations as production. In an on-premises solution, an additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more. These tasks can be time consuming and expensive. Meanwhile, the new featureâ€™s time-to-market increases while the developers wait for the QA environment.
 
In contrast, by running your application in the cloud, you can replicate an entire production environment in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, the solution is managed over the internet.
